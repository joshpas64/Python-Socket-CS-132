# Python-Socket-CS-132
This is a folder containing programs that show the use of sockets to make or connect to rudimentary HTTP and SMTP server

PLEASE Note the multithreading is more complicated to implement in real time and this program took me days to figure out. Make sure to find out which ports you can use for a TCP connection. 

A more appropriate server is in the file that has answer at the end of it. 

If you are going to use images or objects try to have them stored in the directory where your server is running

For a multithreaded server running TCP using libraries HTTP Server, Select, HTTP multithreading server, or UDP (SOCK_DGRAM) seemed to be more functional and easier to understand from what I found online.

Also for an email client using more secure connections or more research in general will be needed to connect to most popular email servers since they require authentication.
